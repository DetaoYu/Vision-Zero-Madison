# Vision-Zero-Madison
Fatalities and serious injuries due to traffic accidents occur within the City of Madison. Current analyses of crash data consider the top streets and intersections where crashes occur, but do not provide highlevel trend analysis. A capital budget funding strategy supported by this data does not currently exist.
The City is considering adopting the Vision Zero strategy, orienting traffic engineering resources to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries while increasing safe, healthy, equitable mobility for all. Analyses of crash data must reflect the Vision Zero strategy.
